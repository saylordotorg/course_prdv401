**Unit 6: Organization and Employee Development** <span id="6"></span> 
*An organization must strategize with its HR Department in an effort to
ensure and promote growth and development of the company and its
employees.  Job analyses linked to performance management, using
training and development as a vehicle to ensure success, are key to
identifying what training needs to occur.  Forecasting future
organizational goals and outcomes is a primary function of HR and will
lead to the development of overall training curriculums, succession
planning, and new orientation packaging.*
