**Unit 10: Global HR: Current Trends and Challenges** <span
id="10"></span> 
*To wrap up your journey in HR, you must take a look at how it is
changing globally.  This unit will discuss the current trends and
challenges influencing HR.  The ability for HR Departments to organize
policies in an effort to solve problems will be crucial to HR playing a
proactive role in workplace issues.  Creating budgets and policies in an
economic downturn will also be a major responsibility of HR.  This will
also mean taking a closer look at health care benefits, by increasing
its focus on employee wellness, in an effort to retain employees and
stay financially viable.*  
  
 *In addition, HR must be ready to train leaders in how to continue to
work with multigenerational populations, manage people globally, and
streamline data and technologies.   “Work Smarter” was a popular phrase
in the 90’s.  “Streamline smarter” may be the new catch phrase for the
next HR generation.*
