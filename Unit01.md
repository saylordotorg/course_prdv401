**Unit 1: The History of Human Resources** <span id="1"></span> 
*To begin your journey in HR101, you must explore the early stages of
Human Resources. The history of human resources had its formal
beginnings with the Industrial Revolution explosion. Around the 1780’s,
how you treated your employees was completely subjective and without any
laws to guide and govern said treatment. Basic treatment of human beings
in the workplace was at the forefront of this new discipline. *  
  
 *Many key players, such as psychologists, were putting their theories
into practice in actual workplaces, including the military. Personnel
management, the predecessor of HR, began to measure and tactically
select and hire employees. Traditional human resource then gave way to
more strategically and purposeful human resource management as it aligns
with HR Law and a more global perspective.*
