**Unit 2: Overview: Employee Life Cycle (Part 1)** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will get a metaview of all major areas in HR and how
they impact the employee.  The employee life cycle is the very essence
of HR.  Ethical standards, policies, and procedures all drive how the
eight major areas of the employee life cycle relate directly to the
company image.  We will take a brief look at each area while evaluating
the importance of each component with regard to commitment to the
employee and the fiduciary responsibilities to the company.  Compliance
with the factors described in the employee life cycle will also be
addressed.*
