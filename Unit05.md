**Unit 5: Ethics and Sustainability** <span id="5"></span> 
*A company’s image can depend entirely on its code of ethics and its
sustainability.  The corporate social responsibility plays an important
role in the community’s perception of the community.  In other words,
how well-liked is the company in the eyes of its surrounding neighbors
and citizens?  Although ethics and sustainability are two different
topics, ethics describes how the company will execute its social
responsibility in the community.*
