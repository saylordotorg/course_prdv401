**Unit 7: HR Law** <span id="7"></span> 
*Unit 2 discussed the Life Cycle of the Employee. This life cycle could
not function adequately without laws to govern the behavior of both the
company and the employee. Companies must be in compliance with all laws
with regard to the corporate environment and its employees. A primary
role of the HR Department is to keep both the company and its employees
out of court. Of course, a company cannot necessarily go to jail, but
there are massive financial penalties involved every day with companies
who have not provided equal opportunities for employees or do not react
to harassment issues. Knowing the laws in your state that affect your
company will be imperative to a successful career in HR.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 3.25 hours to complete.

    is so important.  The concept of diversity will be framed in a
    number of ways within this reading, i.e. as economic payback (people
    who have previous been excluded from the workplace are typically
    more reliant on social service programs) and as social
    responsibility (improving the quality of life for disenfranchised
    groups of people).  Please ensure you identify and process each of
    the diversity frameworks and the potential impact they can have on
    business success.
