**Unit 3: Interactive Phases: Employee Life Cycle (Part 2)** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will focus on the first four components of the
employee life cycle. Understanding the role of HR in attraction,
recruitment, and expectancy of its employees is important in setting the
tone of the company image, of all major areas in HR, and how they impact
the employee.  The employee life cycle is the very essence of HR. 
Understanding and following an HR department in its recruitment and
selection process of an employee is crucial to hiring the right person
the first time.  This component of the life cycle is imperative in that
it can save or cost the company many thousands of dollars.*
