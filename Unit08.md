**Unit 8: Performance Consulting** <span id="8"></span> 
*Internal performance consulting within an HR Department has been around
since the 1980’s.  Typically, a company will bring in someone from HR to
create training as a solution to an issue within another department.  In
this unit, you will identify how performance consulting uses systematic
and systemic methods to assess, interpret, and provide solutions to
workplace issues.  Issues can be people related or systems and processes
related.  It is important to note that a training class will not always
be the answer to work place issues.*
