The purpose of Introduction to Human Resources Management is to provide
a general overview of the concepts and applications of the many parts of
Human Resources (HR).  This course is for the entry level HR Generalist
who wants to explore how the interdependence of the major topics in HR
are created and implemented.  Upon completion of this course, you will
be able to apply your knowledge to real world HR issues.  While general
topics such as benefits and compensation will be covered in other Human
Resource Management courses, this course will focus primarily on the
employee life cycle and each of its phases.  The employee life cycle is
central to most of the functions and purposes of HR.  It is important to
start at the beginning of any life cycle in an effort to understand how
each component is dependent on the next. To begin with, you will take a
look at the history of HR and determine the major events and champion
theorists who brought HR to its humble beginnings.  The course will then
cover the employee life cycle by first looking at the areas of
recruitment, selection, and hiring.  Each area will be defined,
described, and broken down into its measurable parts.  Next, after you
have hired your employees, you must send them to the next phase of the
life cycle: orientation.  This is where employees learn the written and
unwritten rules of the company’s code of conduct.  In addition, an
overview of employee services and benefits and how the role of HR
impacts these services and benefits will be investigated.  In this
course, you will also explore the HR role in performance management. 
This is an area wherein clear expectations, policies, and management
training are aligned with the performance management system used by the
company, which in many cases are created by HR. This course will address
many different HR laws that govern the topics mentioned above. 
Understanding how HR law impacts each area of the employee life cycle is
crucial to the legal and financial obligations of any HR Department. 
Human Resource Departments play a very important role in creating a fair
and legal working environment for its employees while keeping the
company out of the court system.  Managing this balance is always quite
the challenge for any HR employee. Lastly, you will look at an in-depth
approach to global human resources by understanding the current trends
and challenges in the workplace.  In Unit 8, you will survey important
training topics in HR that will keep companies proactive and viable in
an ever changing economy.

### Course Information

Welcome to HR101:Introduction to Human Resources Management!  General
information on the course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer: **Dana Boyd, PhD  
  
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   [*Human Resource
    Management*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Human%20Resource%20Management.pdf)
-   [*The Business Ethics
    Workshop*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Business%20Ethics%20Workshop.pdf)
-   New Jersey Institute of Technology’s OpenCourseware: Dr. Naomi
    Rotter’s [Human Resource Management
    Lectures](http://ocw.njit.edu/som/hrm/hrm-303/index.php)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Activity
-   Subunit 1.3.1 Assessment
-   Unit 2 Activity
-   Subunit 2.2 Assessment
-   Unit 3 Activity
-   Subunit 3.2 Assessment
-   Unit 4 Activity
-   Subunit 4.1 Assessment
-   Unit 5 Activity
-   Subunit 5.1 Assessment
-   Unit 6 Activity
-   Subunit 6.2 Assessment
-   Unit 7 Activity
-   Subunit 7.1 Assessment
-   Unit 8 Activity
-   Subunit 8.1.1 Activity
-   Unit 9 Activity
-   Subunit 9.2.2 Assessment
-   Unit 10 Activity
-   Subunit 10.1.1 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the activities and quizzes listed above.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **33.25
hours** to complete, including quizzes and learning activities.  Each
unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of time you are
expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you plan your time
accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to
complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself.  For example,
Unit 1 should take you 3.25 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with your
calendar and decide to complete Unit 1 (a total of 3.25 hours) on Monday
night; Unit 2 (a total of 4 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions: **As you are going through the units, it is helpful
to take notes on each resource.  Later, you can make flash cards to
study from your notes.  In addition, reading your notes into a recorder
and then playing them back will also enhance learning.  We know in the
psychology of learning and memory that in order to have material learned
it helps to read, speak, write, and/or hear the material about seven to
nine times.  These notes will be useful as a review for your Final
Exam.  The problem sets provided will give you “hands on” experience
with developing and creating many usable work products and documents
from each unit.  Good luck!
